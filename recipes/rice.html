<p><h3>Description</h3>
This is  a recipe for chicken fried rice i she best fried rice in the world and is super easy to make
all you need is rice water salt and a stove    </p>
<p>I knew I was making this to pair with Kung Pao Chicken from this site and as such, wanted this as simple and understated as possible to enhance the other recipe - not compete with it. As such, replaced the peas and carrots with diced onions and celery - which also meant I could skip step straight to step3 - sauting the onions/celery first, then adding the garlic, then adding the eggs then rice. The soy sauce is minimal so, as a main dish, I might double but for the way I planned to use it? Perfect. Again, as a main dish, might need a protein or even some siracha but, as an accompanying side? This is exactly how you want it! Glad I made and would make again! Thanks jostande</p>
